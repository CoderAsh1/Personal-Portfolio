      <h3>A Little About Me </h3>
      <p>
        I graduated from BPUT (Biju Pattanik University of Technology) on 2019
        in Mechanical Engineering.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have a Passion in Computers since i was a kid, I even build my self a
        Custom PC and I had a lot of fun building it. I always wanted to do
        something with Computers. After a lot of exploring I stumbled upon Web
        Development and I really loved it.
